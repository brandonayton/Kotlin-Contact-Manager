# Kotlin Contact Manager

## Overview

I made a Contact Manager app to learn Kotlin and build something useful. This project lets me practice coding by creating a real program that people could actually use.

The app is a simple text-based program that helps you keep track of your contacts. You can:
- Add new contacts with their name, phone number, and email
- See all your contacts in a list
- Search for specific contacts
- Edit contact information if something changes
- Delete contacts you don't need anymore
- Everything saves to a file so your contacts aren't lost when you close the program

I wanted to learn how Kotlin works and make something practical at the same time. It was a good way to understand how real apps store and organize data.

## Development Environment

I used **IntelliJ IDEA** to write the code. It's a free program that helps you write and test Kotlin code.

The app is written in Kotlin, which is a programming language that runs on the Java platform. I used:
- Basic Kotlin features (like variables and loops)
- Lists to store all the contacts
- Files to save data between uses
- Simple text input/output for the menu

## Future Work

Here are some things I could add later:
- **A real interface** - Instead of just text, make it look like a normal app with buttons and windows
- **Photos** - Let users add photos to their contacts
- **Backup** - Save contacts to the cloud so you don't lose them
- **Categories** - Let users organize contacts into groups like "Family" or "Work"
- **Birthday reminders** - Get reminders when it's someone's birthday
- **Share contacts** - Let users share contacts with other people

## How to Use

1. Download and install IntelliJ IDEA and Java SDK
2. Open the project files
3. Click the "Run" button
4. Follow the menu options to manage your contacts
